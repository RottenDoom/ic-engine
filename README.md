# ic-engine
My Game Engine Project. This game engine uses vulkan api for rendering and I plan to make my own game in this engine.

# TODOs
1. The input system is rigged. I used the c-style event system which is robust but I am not sure about its memory. I am looking forward to making and designing my own event system. For now if I explicitely apply a event some codes are not registered while others are not. Escape registered but the others are not. I am making the event system in the test branch where I will test my own event system that will work seemlessly and with no errors.

2. After completing input start with renderer.

3. Continue the Kohi Game engine series. I do not want to make my own math library so I am going to use glm. Probably gonna make another branch in my tutorial github repo to test it.
